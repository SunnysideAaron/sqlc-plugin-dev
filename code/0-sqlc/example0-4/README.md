# example0-4: Configuration

PostgreSQL

A copy of example-2 but with config settings in sqlc.yaml to make it easier to test what each setting does.

Some commands that might be useful.

    cd /home/code/0-sqlc/example0-4/
    sqlc generate
    go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5
    go build ./...
    go run tutorial.go
